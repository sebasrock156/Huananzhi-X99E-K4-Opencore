> Based on Apple's roadmap for MacOS 15 Preview, thanks to iMac Pro from 2017, we have 1 year more of Hackintosh ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‡ðŸŽ†
> So, when Beta and first final builds are released, I will try to do a new EFI with Opencore to run Sequoia on this motherboard.

Usually, when Apple shows a new MacOS version, the newer revisions of their previous OS version are based in the new code, so, boot arguments, GPU detection and Security Integrity Protocol are updated too and Opencore needs be re-adapted to the changes.
